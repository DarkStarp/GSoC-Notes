When the terminal Starts it reads various files for various modes.

For example it reads ~/.zshrc file when open in interactive mode.

So we compile a c program to write "VARoDeK" on terminal.

then add the path to .out file of our c program in ~/.zshrc file.

So everytime you open terminal, it will run that C command.
