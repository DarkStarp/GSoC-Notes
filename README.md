This Repo conatins all the notes which I have made while experimenting and exploring with the things.

* The basic purpose of this repository is to note down all the process and steps I followed while doing some specfic project.

I have no intention to copy the content of any site or copy the work of any other author. If I had to reference any content, Citation is properly done on that specific note.
